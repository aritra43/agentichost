## Healthcare Appointment and Management System - Software Requirements Specification

This document outlines the software requirements for a new healthcare appointment and management system.  The system aims to improve patient access to care for SMEs by providing a cost-effective, scalable, and secure solution.

**1. Introduction**

This system addresses the limited digital reach of small and medium-sized healthcare providers (SMEs), improving patient care access. Many SMEs lack resources for robust digital platforms, reducing market share and patient satisfaction. This system offers a cost-effective, scalable solution, enabling SMEs to compete effectively in the digital healthcare landscape.  It provides a user-friendly interface for patients and providers, streamlining appointment scheduling, management, and medical record access. This improves efficiency, reduces administrative overhead, and enhances the patient experience.  Successful implementation bridges the gap between smaller healthcare providers and patients seeking convenient access to care.

**1.1 Purpose**

This document guides stakeholders (developers, designers, project managers) by providing requirements for the system's development and deployment.  Business goals are improving patient access, increasing SME market share, and reducing administrative burdens. Technical goals include developing a scalable, secure, user-friendly multi-tenant SaaS application compliant with HIPAA and GDPR. Success will be measured by provider adoption, increased appointments, and improved patient satisfaction. KPIs will track user engagement, system performance, and security breaches.

**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective**

The system will be a web and mobile application accessible to patients, doctors, healthcare staff, and system administrators.  It will integrate with existing EHR systems (via HL7, FHIR, or CDA) and payment gateways.

**2.2 Product Functions**

* **Patient Functions:**
    * Register and create a profile.
    * Schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments.
    * Access medical records (read-only).
    * Access and download prescriptions.
    * Use an AI-driven symptom checker.
    * Receive appointment reminders (email and SMS).
* **Doctor Functions:**
    * View and manage appointments.
    * Access and update patient medical records (read-write).
    * Create and manage prescriptions.
    * Receive appointment notifications.
* **Healthcare Staff Functions:**
    * Manage appointments (including cancellation and rescheduling).
    * Manage services and doctors.
    * Onboard and offboard doctors.
    * Generate reports and analytics.
    * Manage user accounts.
* **System Administrator Functions:**
    * System configuration and maintenance.
    * User account management.

**2.3 User Characteristics**

* Patients: Varying levels of technical proficiency.
* Doctors: Experienced healthcare professionals.
* Healthcare Staff: Administrative and clinical staff.
* System Administrator: Technically proficient individuals.

**2.4 Operating Environment**

* The system will be a multi-tenant SaaS application hosted on a secure cloud platform.
* It will be accessible via web browsers and mobile devices (iOS and Android).
* It will integrate with third-party EHR systems and payment gateways.

**2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints**

* Compliance with HIPAA and GDPR regulations.
* Scalability to accommodate a growing number of users and healthcare providers.
* Security to protect sensitive patient data.
* Interoperability with various EHR systems.

**2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies**

* Healthcare providers will grant access to their EHR systems.
* Adequate infrastructure and resources will be available.
* Stakeholders will participate actively in the project.
* EHR systems support standard data exchange formats (HL7, FHIR, CDA).

**3. Specific Requirements**

**3.1 Functional Requirements**

*(Detailed functional requirements from the BRD will be inserted here, expanded with use cases and UI mockups in subsequent documentation.)*

**3.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

| Requirement Category | Specific Requirement | Measurable Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Response time for API requests | 95% of requests under 100ms |
| Performance | Database query response time | Under 200ms for transactional queries |
| Scalability | User capacity | Must handle 10,000 concurrent users with acceptable response times |
| Security | Data encryption | All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256) |
| Security | Authentication | Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required |
| Security | Authorization | Role-based access control (RBAC) |
| Availability | Uptime | 99.99% uptime |
| Maintainability | Mean time to restore (MTTR) | Under 1 hour |
| Compliance | HIPAA/GDPR | Full compliance with all relevant regulations |
| Usability | User interface design | User-friendly and intuitive interface |

**3.3 Technical Requirements**

* Technology Stack:  (To be defined based on further analysis and feasibility studies, considering scalability, security, and maintainability.  Cloud-based infrastructure is mandatory.)
* Database:  (To be defined, considering scalability, security, and data integrity requirements.  SQL database is preferred.)
* APIs:  (To be defined for integration with EHR systems and payment gateways.  Secure API design principles must be followed.)
* Security Protocols:  (TLS 1.3 or later, secure coding practices, regular security audits.)
* Deployment: Multi-tenant SaaS deployment on a reputable cloud provider.

**4. Data Model**

*(Refer to the data model section in the BRD.  This section should be expanded to include detailed entity-relationship diagrams, database schemas, attribute definitions, and data flow explanations.  Normalization principles should be clearly stated.)*

**5. Out of Scope**

* Integration with third-party suppliers (ambulance services, pharmacies, medical tourism).
* Inpatient services.
* Aggregator model for patient-provider connections (patients limited to a single provider's app).
* Telehealth video conferencing.
* Complex medical billing and insurance integration.

**6. Assumptions**

* Healthcare providers will grant access to their Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.
* Adequate infrastructure and resources will be available for development and deployment.
* Stakeholders will actively participate in the project's lifecycle.
* The healthcare providers’ EHR systems are capable of exchanging data in standard formats (HL7, FHIR, or CDA).
