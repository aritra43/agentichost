# Healthcare Application Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the software requirements for a multi-tenant, cloud-based healthcare application designed to facilitate appointment scheduling, management, and other related services for small and medium-sized healthcare providers.  This application addresses the growing need for efficient and accessible healthcare solutions, particularly for providers who may lack the resources to develop and maintain their own complex systems.  The application's multi-tenant architecture ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness, while its cloud-based nature ensures high availability and accessibility for both providers and patients.  The system will adhere to strict data privacy regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR.

## 2. Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) serves as a comprehensive guide for all stakeholders involved in the development and deployment of the healthcare application. It clearly defines the functional and non-functional requirements, technical specifications, and project scope, ensuring a shared understanding and facilitating effective communication throughout the development lifecycle.  This document bridges the gap between business objectives (improved patient access, increased provider efficiency, streamlined administrative processes) and technical implementation details.  It will be used to guide the design, development, testing, and deployment phases of the project.

## 3. Scope

This project focuses on building a HIPAA and GDPR compliant multi-tenant, cloud-based healthcare application offering functionalities for appointment scheduling, management, and related services. It explicitly covers functional requirements such as patient registration, medical profile management, appointment booking, prescription management, secure communication, and basic reporting.  Non-functional aspects like performance, scalability, security, availability, maintainability, and interoperability are also addressed. The project adheres to relevant regulatory and operational standards and ensures data integrity and protection. This application will be accessible via both web and mobile interfaces.  It will integrate with existing EHR systems and payment gateways, subject to the availability of appropriate APIs and the provider's consent.  The system will be designed for ease of use by all user types.

## 4. In Scope

The following features and functionalities are explicitly included in the project scope:

* **Patient-centric Features:**
    * **Patient Registration and Login (FR001):** Patients can create accounts using their mobile phone numbers and OTP verification. Profiles include personal information, medical history (with options for patients to input data or for providers to input data), and emergency contacts. Robust security measures, including data encryption at rest and in transit, will be implemented.  The system will provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure patients' consent for data usage and sharing is obtained and tracked.
    * **Medical Profile Creation/Update (FR002):** Patients, doctors, and staff can create and update patient medical profiles with details such as allergies, chronic conditions, medications (including dosage), family history, lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise habits), and immunization records.  Data integrity will be maintained through regular backups and auditing. Data access will be controlled based on defined roles and permissions.
    * **Appointment Booking/Rescheduling (FR003):** Patients can easily book and reschedule appointments online, receiving timely notifications (via email and SMS). Rescheduling will be permitted up to 24 hours prior to the appointment.  The system will track the appointment history and provide clear visuals on appointment status (e.g., scheduled, completed, canceled, missed).
    * **Prescription Management (FR004):** Doctors and staff can create, modify, and view prescriptions. Patients can view their prescriptions securely. Prescriptions will be securely stored and accessible only to authorized personnel and the patient.  The system will generate clear and printable prescription formats that can be easily read and verified.
    * **Secure Communication (FR005):** Secure messaging capabilities (encrypted communications) will be provided for direct communication between patients and providers.  HIPAA and GDPR compliance will be strictly enforced.  Audit logs will track all communication and access.
    * **Symptom Checker (FR006):** An AI-driven symptom checker will assist patients in identifying potential health issues and recommending appropriate healthcare professionals. The accuracy and limitations of the symptom checker will be clearly communicated to users.
    * **Payment Gateway Integration (FR014):** Secure online payment processing will be integrated for appointment fees.  The system will provide multiple payment options and integrate seamlessly with reputable payment gateways.

* **Provider-centric Features:**
    * **Doctor Scheduling/Management (FR007):** Doctors can manage their schedules and appointments, including setting availability, viewing appointments, and updating appointment statuses.
    * **Service Management (FR008):** Staff can manage the services offered by the clinic or healthcare provider, including creating, updating, and deleting services.
    * **User Onboarding/Offboarding (FR009):** Staff can onboard and offboard doctors and other staff members.  The system will provide user-friendly processes for managing user accounts and permissions.
    * **Appointment Management (FR010):** Staff and doctors can manage appointments (create, cancel, modify). Cancellation policies and procedures will be clearly defined and implemented. The system should have reporting and analysis to support operational and financial decisions related to appointment management.
    * **Report Generation (FR011):** Staff can generate management reports related to appointment scheduling, patient demographics, financial data, and other relevant metrics. Reporting capabilities should include customizable reports, data export options (e.g., CSV, PDF, Excel), and data visualization dashboards.
    * **User Management (FR012):** Admins can manage user accounts and access levels, including creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts. Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to ensure data security.
    * **EHR System Integration (FR013):** The system will integrate with existing EHR systems to facilitate seamless data exchange (NFR008). Specific integration protocols (HL7, FHIR, CDA) will be determined during the design phase.  The integration will be designed to ensure data consistency and avoid data duplication.

## 5. Out of Scope

Integration with third-party suppliers such as ambulance operators, pharmacists, and medical tourism services are out of scope for this application's initial release. Currently, this application does not support the inpatient journey of patients. Since this is a multi-tenant SaaS environment, this application will not follow an aggregator model. Hence, each patient will be linked to a single healthcare provider app.  Future iterations may consider expanding these functionalities.  Risks associated with excluding these features include reduced patient convenience and potential loss of revenue opportunities.  A detailed risk assessment addressing these considerations will be part of project planning.

## 6. Assumptions

* This project assumes that healthcare providers will allow interfacing this application with their existing EHR systems (Electronic Health Records).  This assumption is crucial for data consistency and efficiency; however, a plan for handling scenarios where integration is not feasible (e.g., using alternative data input methods) will be developed.
* The implications of this assumption changing include the need for additional data migration efforts, potential delays in the project timeline, and increased development costs. A contingency plan will be documented to address this risk.

## 7. Dependencies

* Integration with existing EHR systems via APIs (HL7, FHIR, or CDA).
* Integration with a reputable payment gateway API.
